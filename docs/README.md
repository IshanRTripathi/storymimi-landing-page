# Audio Placeholder Files

This directory contains placeholder audio files for the StoryMimi landing page.

## Files needed:
- background.mp3: Soft, magical background music for the landing page
- demo-narration.mp3: Sample parent voice narration for the personalization demo

## Notes:
- These should be replaced with actual audio files
- Background music should be soft and child-friendly
- Demo narration should showcase the quality of AI voice cloning
- All audio files should be optimized for web (compressed, appropriate bitrate)

## Recommended audio content:
- Background: Gentle, whimsical instrumental music with soft piano and strings
- Demo narration: "Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a brave little adventurer named [Child's Name]. This is how your child's personalized story sounds when narrated in your own voice."
